_Assuming a new cross-platform desktop project_

_[Origin - Source](https://github.com/devbitesau/quickshots/blob/main/origin/OriginGame.cs)_

## Assets
This excercise will be using the _MetalPanel.png_ asset from [Kenny UI Elements](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/background-elements) - full credit to Kenny for the creation. There is also a bar image for drawing the intersection lines.

Load this into the content tool, remembering to build afterward.
